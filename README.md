## Introduction

**nf-core/magmap** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for mapping reads to a (large) collections of genomes.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

1. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))
3. Quality trimming and adapters removal for raw reads ([`Trim Galore!`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/))
4. Filter reads with [`BBduk`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/)
5. Select reference genomes based on k-mer signatures in reads with [`sourmash`](https://sourmash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
6. Quantification of genes identified in selected reference genomes:
   1. generate index of assembly ([`BBmap index`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/))
   2. Mapping cleaned reads to the assembly for quantification ([`BBmap`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/))
   3. Get raw counts per each gene present in the genomes ([`Featurecounts`](http://subread.sourceforge.net)) -> TSV table with collected featurecounts output
7. Summary statistics table. Collect_stats.R

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
CONTROL_REP2,AEG588A1_S2_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S2_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

And, if you want to map to a set of your own genomes, a genome information file looking like this:

`genomeinfo.csv`:

```csv
accno,genome_fna,genome_gff
genome1,path/to/fna.gz,path/to/gff.gz
genome2,path/to/fna.gz,path/to/gff.gz
genome3,path/to/fna.gz,path/to/gff.gz
```

Each row represents a genome file with or without the paired gff

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/magmap --input samplesheet.csv --genomeinfo genomeinfo.csv --outdir <OUTDIR> -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
```

:::warning
Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
:::

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/magmap/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/magmap/parameters).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/magmap/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
